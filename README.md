This application is designed to help users better manage their financial situation. It prevents the registration of new users with the same username or email address by checking these details, ensuring that only new users who are not already registered in the system can sign up seamlessly.

Once registered, users can update their information or delete their accounts. Additionally, an automatic email notification is sent to each new user, streamlining the registration process. Each individual can manage their own income and expense tables and add expenses according to the categories they create.

Users also have the ability to edit or delete their added income, expenses, and categories. On the homepage, a pie chart visualizes their financial situation by displaying the total income and expenses, providing users with a clear overview of their finances.
